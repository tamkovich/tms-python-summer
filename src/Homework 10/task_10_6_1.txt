My favourite season is summer.
It is often sunny and hot outdoors.
The sky is blue and trees and grass are green.
I play football in the street and ride my bike.
I like summer because I go to the sea with my parents.
I can swim very well.
We usually have fun together there.
I like summer because I have summer holidays.
